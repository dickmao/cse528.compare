For Visual Studio:

BUILD PBRT
1. Navigate to "src" folder
2. Select the folder corresponding to your version of Visual Studio
		(ie. For Visual Studio 2012, you would navigate to the "pbrt.vs2012" folder)
3. Open the solution file: "pbrt.sln"
4. Switch the desired mode to Debug/Release and x32/x64
5. Build solution (File->Build Solution or just press F7)
		All 8 solutions should successfully build
		
RUN PBRT 
Method 1 (Quick and easy)
1. Right click the pbrt project and go to "Properties"
2. Go to Configuration Properties->Debugging
3. Put the following in "Command Arguments":
		../../scenes/bunny.pbrt

This will run the bunny scene from a few folders over and output it the result as pbrt.exr.
The output will be in the solution folder (from the build section). 

Method 2 (Preferred)
1. Set up a system environmental variable called PBRT_SEARCHPATH that points to the pbrt bin folder
	(ie. C:\pbrt-v2\bin)

2. Install cygwin with the bison and flex packages (Note: these packages aren't selected by default so you have to search and make sure they are not "Skipped")

3. Add the following to the end of your .bashrc file (usually something like C:/cygwin64/etc/bash.bashrc):
	
	export PBRT_SEARCHPATH=/cygdrive/c/pbrt-v2/bin
	export PATH=$PBRT_SEARCHPATH:$PATH
	
	where the c/pbrt-v2/bin portion depends on where you have your pbrt bin folder (same as part 1 of this method).
	
4. Open a cygwin terminal and navigate to the scene file you want to run
	For example, in the cygwin terminal write:
	cd /cygdrive/c/pbrt-v2/scenes/
	
5. Run pbrt with the following:
	pbrt bunny.pbrt
	
This will run the bunny scene in this folder and output the result as pbrt.exr in the same folder

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

pbrt [--ncores numOfCores] [--outfile nameOfOutput] [--quick] [--quiet] [--verbose] [--help] <filename.pbrt>

For example a typical pbrt command might look something like this:
pbrt --ncores 8 --outfile bunny.exr bunny.pbrt

which would run pbrt on the bunny scene with 8 cores (multithreaded) and output the rendered image as bunny.exr in the current folder.

Note: Method 1 would not need the "pbrt" part of the above command. Method 2 would use the command as is.

The first time I installed pbrt I used this site as a resource (http://qiaohongli.blogspot.com/2012/07/install-pbrt-for-windows-7-visual.html).
